# Stock Price Prediction
CMPE 257 Team Project
 
The stock market is a great place to earn extra money if invested wisely. If people are new to the stock
market, it is really hard for them to determine which stock and what price should be invested. Thus, stock
price prediction is important for everyone who would like to do investment. It could help investors and
bankers to understand more the current situation and the trend of stock. There are multiple ways to predict
the stock price, but which one will make the most accurate prediction? In this project, different machine
learning algorithms will be implemented for predicting the stock price.
